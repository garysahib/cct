Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs the whole thing boiled down to the top bullet points:

‚∏ª

	‚Ä¢	Keep OIDC/OAuth as source of truth, but never hand those tokens to agents.
	‚Ä¢	Introduce CCTs (Capabilities & Context Tokens): short-lived, proof-of-possession tokens encoding what, where, with which data, and for what prompt/model.
	‚Ä¢	CCT structure: issuer, subject (agent), act-as user, audience (tools/services), capabilities (tool + scope + limits), context (model, prompt hash, purpose, chain), proof (DPoP/mTLS), short expiry.
	‚Ä¢	Attenuation: agents can mint child CCTs that only narrow (never expand) capabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Runtime authN/Z inline: every tool call checked against CCT + live signals (risk, posture, data labels).
	‚Ä¢	OPA/Rego enforcement: embed in tool adapters or call via Envoy ext_authz.
	‚Ä¢	Data segmentation: label and split data by tenant, geography, sensitivity, PII, etc.; enforce ‚Äúfilter-before-search‚Äù in vector DBs; redact/mask at boundaries.
	‚Ä¢	Verification gates:
	1.	Input gate (prompt validation, hash, jailbreak detection)
	2.	Plan gate (check proposed tools vs CCT)
	3.	Execution gate (inline checks per call, rate limits, redaction)
	4.	Explainer/Verifier (check outputs, prevent leakage, run DLP/factual checks)
	5.	Output gate (log, audit, provenance, emit signals)
	‚Ä¢	Signals bus: publish cct.issued, cct.child_issued, cct.revoked, cct.denied, agent.plan_flagged, data.accessed for SIEM/risk engines.
	‚Ä¢	Security posture:
	‚Ä¢	Short TTLs (30‚Äì120s)
	‚Ä¢	Proof-of-possession (DPoP/mTLS)
	‚Ä¢	No broad bearer tokens
	‚Ä¢	Strong audit/provenance via chain_id
	‚Ä¢	Implementation stack:
	‚Ä¢	AAG (Agent Access Gateway): OIDC ‚Üí CCT minting, attenuation
	‚Ä¢	OPA/Rego bundle: for policies (tool, scope, limits, signals)
	‚Ä¢	Envoy ext_authz: inline enforcement at tool adapters
	‚Ä¢	Adapters: embed checks + redaction logic before calling tools

‚∏ª

üëâ Net effect: you contain AI agents with capability-scoped, context-aware tokens, enforce policies dynamically, and gate every prompt/task with a verification pipeline ‚Äî no raw OAuth tokens, no over-broad access, full auditability.
